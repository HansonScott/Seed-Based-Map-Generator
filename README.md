# Seed-Based Map Generator

Demonstrate and explore the 'seed' based random generator concepts to create maps.

# Theory
- a random map is governed by the seed, which generates lots of random, but predictable content
- also, many parameters can/should be employed to tailor the bounds of the map and the generated objects within

# Features
- prototype the Math.Random(seed) function to generate lots of content (lots of pseudo-random numbers)
- create basic content from the random numbers and parameters
- a windows form UI for input variables and map display
